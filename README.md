# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## Automation

If you would like some automation, the `install.sh` script will automatically setup dotfiles. [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is the only requirement. Clone this repo in a directory that is an immediate child of your home directory (e.g. `~/dotfiles`) and run `./install.sh`. This will also setup defaults and install packages I find useful. If you don't care about that and just want to install dotfiles, run `./install.sh -i`.
