# Setting up a new laptop
A not-so-ordered list of things I had to do while setting up my new laptop. Most of these things are work specific.

## Things to install:
- Chrome and/or ff. Sign in to get extenions.
- Xcode
- Homebrew
- iTerm
- oh-my-zsh (after installing zsh below)
- Docker
- Virtual box
- Vagrant

## Brew install:
- zsh
- zsh-completions
- reattach-to-user-namespace
- vim (override system vim)
- tmux


## Random notes
If vim registers don't work, `chown $USER ~/.viminfo` and `chmod u+w .viminfo`
