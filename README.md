# Setting up a new laptop

A not-so-ordered list of things I had to do while setting up my new laptop. Most of these things are work specific.

### Things to Install

#### General

* Chrome and/or FF
* Xcode
* Homebrew
* iTerm
* oh-my-zsh (after installing zsh below)
* Docker

#### Homebrew

* zsh
* zsh-completions
* reattach-to-user-namespace
* neovim (override system vim)
* tmux
* brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts && brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
* font-source-code-pro

## iTerm2

I float back and forth between using `Jetbrains Darcula` and some sort of `Nord` colorscheme. They can be found at [iterm2colorschemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).
