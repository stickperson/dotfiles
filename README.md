# Setting up a new laptop

A not-so-ordered list of things I had to do while setting up my new laptop. Most of these things are work specific.

## Things to Install

* Chrome and/or FF
* Xcode
* Homebrew
* iTerm2. I float back and forth between using `Jetbrains Darcula` and some sort of `Nord` colorscheme. They can be found at [iterm2colorschemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).
* oh-my-zsh (after installing zsh below)
* Docker

## Packages

After installing above requirements, run `./install.sh` to install required packages.
